CHECK_ONE_NAGIOS
================

Ever had a Nagios server behaving in a strange way?
Like:
* error message: "having result for foo but service|host foo does not exists in config file"
* still receiving alerts after suspending alert for that user?

Maybe you have an old nagios instance running, while the new instance is also running. but the old one is running based on an old configuration.

This should'nt happend. But I've been hit by that several time. the check_nagios check script can only detect you have at least one nagios process. but nagios can run a lot of forked/parallel process and it's hard to detect which ones are the main process.

Well finally I sax that on my linux server a ps auxf|grep nagios will render a STATUS column where the main Nagios process have the "Ssl" status and the othersonly "S". And when I have two (or even 3) "Ssl" status nagios process bad things happen. So I wrote this simple bash script to be uased as a classical nagios check and detect I have more than one nagios process in "Ssl" status.
