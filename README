CHECK_ONE_NAGIOS
================

Ever had a Nagios server behaving in a strange way?
Like:
* error message: "having result for foo but service|host foo does not exists in config file"
* still receiving alerts after suspending alert for that user?

Maybe you have an old nagios instance running, while the new instance is also running. but the old one is running based on an old configuration.

This shouldn't happend. But I've been hit by it several time. The existing check_nagios check script can only detect you have at least one nagios process. but nagios can run a lot of forked/parallel process and it's hard to detect which one is the main process.

Well finally I saw that on my linux server a ps auxf|grep nagios would render a STATUS column where the main Nagios process have the "Ssl" status and the others only "S". And when I have two (or even 3) "Ssl" status nagios process bad things happen. So I wrote this simple bash script to be used as a classical nagios check and detect I have more than one nagios process in "Ssl" status.
